Project Title - Virtual-Pets:

A project designed to give an overview on the core concepts of object-oriented programming. In this project I will create javascript "pets" which have names and can do a series of interactive things. For example, they will get older (until death), they will get hungry (and can be fed), and they will need to be taken for walks to increase their fitness. This exercise will hopefully reinforce my understanding of the core concepts behing OOP. 

This project will be built using javascript. 

If you would like to run the project, you can install it using git clone from my github repository (link below), and running npm install in the cloned repository to download its dependencies. You can run the tests that come with the project by using "npm test" on the command line inside the repository.
