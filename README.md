<h1> Virtual-Pets </h1>

A project designed to give an overview on the core concepts of object-oriented programming. In this project we created javascript "pets" , that can do a series of interactive things. For example, they can get older (until death), they will get hungry (and can be fed), and they will need to be taken for walks to increase their fitness. This exercise was extremely useful in reinforcing my understanding of the core concepts of OOP. 

Furthermore, the project acted as an introduction to TDD, as we were required to write tests utilising Jest for all of our functions, to ensure our product was working correctly. 

<h2> Running this project </h2>

If you would like to run this project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine, and then fork the repo to your local machine 

Now run Node.js inside the repo to install the project dependencies, including Jest which will allow you to run and write tests for the project. 

<h2> Project Features </h2>

Pets will die if they become older than 30 days old
Pets will die if their hunger goes above 10. They can be fed using the feed function which will reduce their hunger by 3.
Pets will die if their fitness falls before zero. They can be walked using the walk function which will increase their fitness by 4. 
As pets get older, they will become less fit and get hungrier. 
Pets can inherit other pets as nested objects using the haveBaby function.
